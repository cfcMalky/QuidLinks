# QuidLinks Project Structure

This project has been reorganized for clarity and scalability. The new structure is:

- `/public` — Static assets (images, icons)
- `/pages` — HTML pages (main site, info, policy, terms, navbar, banner, offers)
- `/scripts` — All JavaScript and Python scripts
- `/data` — CSVs, text data, sitemap
- `/styles` — CSS files
- Root — Config files (package.json, .gitignore, README.md)

A reorganization script is available to move files into this structure. Restore from backup if needed or customize as you wish.
